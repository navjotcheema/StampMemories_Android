Use of Your Information and Your Preferences
We may use your personal information to personalize your User experience, to provide targeted advertising and marketing, to process transactions, to administer contests, promotions, surveys, or other features, to contact Users in order to send them information and updates pertaining to their orders, to respond to inquires and provide customer service, to send company news, updates and other related information, and to offer additional services to Users in which they may be interested based on their purchasing trends.

How to Opt-Out
In addition to the forgoing uses, we may also use personal information to contact Users through our opt-out mailing list to which all Users who provide their email address shall be automatically added. Users may at any time opt out to receiving information via the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of certain emails or by responding to any email received with a request to remove said User. Users should note that opting-out does not prevent us from contacting you regarding your account or any transactions.

Email marketing campaigns published by us may contain tracking facilities within the actual email. Subscriber activity is tracked and stored in a database for future analysis and evaluation. Such tracked activity may include but shall not be limited to: the opening of emails, forwarding of emails, the clicking of links within the email content, times, dates, and frequency of activity. This information is used to refine future email campaigns and supply the User with more relevant content based around their activity.

Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosure
Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising as discussed in the “How to Opt-Out” section above, and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your Web browser as described in the “Use of Cookies” section below, some Web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the Web sites you encounter while Web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. We do not respond to Web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about “do not track,” visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
